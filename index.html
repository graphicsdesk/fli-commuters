But in accordance with <a href="https://housing.columbia.edu/content/eligibility-0">Columbia Housing</a> policy, he lost his guaranteed housing and was placed on the non-guaranteed wait list for the 2021-22 school year. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> From Aug. 1 to Aug. 15, “it was just a waiting game.” With no response from Columbia Housing, Amaya said the uncertainty of his dorming situation gave him anxiety as a first-generation, low-income, and housing-insecure student. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “The only thing I wish I had seen from the administration is why a student must lose guaranteed housing in taking a year off, especially during the pandemic. They know that I have that demonstrated need—it’s on record, it’s on file,” Amaya said. “Their lack of policy considerations for my situation led me to this. I’m living off campus because Columbia didn’t house me.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Amaya now lives 45 minutes away from campus in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and commutes daily, which poses a particular set of challenges as an FLI student. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “It’s hard to not talk about money without [talking about] time,” Amaya said. “By commuting, I lose two hours in a day. Two hours I could spend studying, I could spend working, that I could spend relaxing.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Gershom Miranda, GS ’22, commutes over an hour by bus and subway from College Point, Queens, to Morningside Heights. In fall 2019, the academic and financial strain of having to balance studying, working at a law firm, and living off campus led him to take a voluntary leave of absence the following spring. </p> <div class="image width-auto"> <img src="X2677XHZDNHL5MMQJGRSJ625JQ.4827dada.tif"> <p class="image-caption-text"> Gershom Miranda is a student at the school of General Studies. <span class="image-credit"> Photograph by Maria Shaughnessy / Columbia Daily Spectator </span> </p> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “I was trying to stay afloat, both at my job and at school. I couldn’t finance my next semester,” Miranda said. “I still [had] an outstanding bill from the previous fall [2019]. I had to work double so I could register for the next semester.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Recently, Miranda moved back in with his family so he could quit working and dedicate more time to his studies. While paying rent is no longer a concern, he spends $127 monthly for a MetroCard, totaling to about $1,524 a year. The Long Island Rail Road, which would cut Miranda’s commute by 25 minutes, would cost an additional $1,284 each year. </p> <div class="graphic"> <style>.shark-1-highlight{max-width:40%;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto}@media (max-width:1000px){.shark-1-highlight{max-width:60%;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto}}@media (max-width:600px){.shark-1-highlight{max-width:90%;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto}}</style> <div class="shark-1-highlight"> <img src="miranda.d7530213.png" alt="Simply Easy Learning" style="max-width:100%;"> </div> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> According to Mario Torres, GS ’22, a commuting student from Greenpoint, Brooklyn, the cost of MTA fares is “not a small amount of money per year to be spending on commuting.” </p> <div class="image width-undefined"> <img src="HBPRCV2BKBFGDCH2LPBLUUF47A.80985c32.tif"> <p class="image-caption-text"> Mario Torres pictured with the bike he commutes to campus on. <span class="image-credit"> Photograph by Maria Shaughnessy / Columbia Daily Spectator </span> </p> </div> <div class="graphic">  <div class="shark-1-highlight"> <img src="torres.869053b8.png" alt="Simply Easy Learning" style="max-width:100%;"> </div> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Despite this, Columbia currently offers <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/2004/03/08/why-dont-we-get-student-discounts-metrocards/">no subsidized MetroCard program</a>, even for FLI students. Meanwhile, peer institutions <a href="https://www.transportation.harvard.edu/commuterchoice/transit">Harvard University</a> and <a href="https://web.mit.edu/facilities/transportation/tpass/students.html">the Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> offer a 50 percent subsidy on monthly Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority passes. Washington University in St. Louis offers its full-time students a Metropolitan St. Louis Transit Agency <a href="https://sustainability.wustl.edu/get-involved/alternative-transportation/public-transportation/">U-pass for free</a>, and universities like the <a href="https://college.uchicago.edu/student-services/cta-u-pass">University of Chicago</a> and the <a href="https://pt.berkeley.edu/StudentEasypass">University of California, Berkeley</a> include public transportation passes as part of their student fees. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Columbia Transportation offers <a href="https://transportation.columbia.edu/content/commuter-shuttles">commuter shuttles</a>, but the <a href="https://transportation.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/content/Documents/Commuter%20Shuttle%20Fall%20Map.pdf">routes</a> are limited for boroughs outside of Manhattan and the fare costs $4.50 each way. Also, seats are available on a first-come, first-served basis and need to be booked in advance. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> In an effort to address this need, Columbia College Student Council introduced a <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2018/10/30/ccsc-moves-forward-with-plan-to-fund-subsidized-metrocards-for-low-income-students/">subsidized MetroCard program</a> for low-income students in 2018. However, the pre-loaded cards <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2019/04/01/ccsc-votes-to-nearly-double-funding-for-metrocard-pilot-program/">only offer six rides each</a>. Jaine Archambeau, CC ’22, the CCSC first-generation and financial security representative, believes this program should be taken on and improved at the institutional level. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “We can give students a couple rides on MetroCards, but at the end of the day, if you’re commuting in, we can’t pay for your travel back and forth,” Archambeau said. “The University has absolutely no transportation stipends, and they don’t have a way to help students with that financial burden.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Along with the cost of transportation, commuting students face an additional expense: food. Even the cheapest campus dining plan, <a href="https://dining.columbia.edu/content/upperclass-dining-plans">Plan D</a>—which provides 75 meals and $75 dining dollars—averages to about $14 a swipe. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> In 2020, the General Studies Office of Educational Financing launched a <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2020/01/22/gs-to-provide-subsidize-meal-plans-for-select-low-income-gs-students/">pilot program to subsidize meal plans</a> for low-income School of General Studies students after a 2018 <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2019/03/28/close-to-40-percent-of-non-joint-or-dual-program-gs-students-experience-food-insecurity-survey-shows/">survey</a> showed nearly 40 percent of General Studies students experienced food insecurity. The plan includes 75 meals per semester with an average cost of $6 per meal. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Yet, neither Amaya, Miranda, nor Torres have a dining plan. For Torres, “buying food around campus is really expensive,” and Miranda mentioned that on-campus options include “$5 coffees and $15 sandwiches.” Because of this, Amaya often asked friends to swipe him into the dining halls. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “I’m thankful I do have a community here on campus that can support me [financially], but it’s almost emotional labor having to reach out and ask for that help,” Amaya said. “I don’t feel that’s something I should be having to be consistently doing.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> As of Oct. 13, Columbia’s dining halls <a href="https://dining.columbia.edu/news/indoor-seating-begin-residential-dining-october-13">no longer accept</a> guest swipes or credit cards for indoor dining. Columbia Dining has restricted indoor seating to vaccinated students with meal plans and if Columbia students did not pick up a token before Oct. 29, then they will have to <a href="https://dining.columbia.edu/news/reintroducing-reusable-go-containers">pay five dollars</a> for reusable containers or 50 cents for compostable to-go containers. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Archambeau and CCSC have identified food accessibility for commuter FLI students as a high-need area and are working on solutions. One idea is to create a resource fund students could use to purchase cookware for on- and off-campus use. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “The institution could help commuting students, and FLI students in general, find resources again, whether that looks like funds, whether it looks like tangible resources, a pan, a pot, anything really,” Archambeau said. “We just thought that might be really helpful specifically for the commuter population at this university.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> However, not having adequate on-campus storage space can make bringing meals from home more difficult. Miranda, who prepares his meals at home, has to take them with him to campus. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “I don’t want to carry so much stuff, but sometimes I have to,” Miranda said. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Free on-campus storage available to commuting students include the second floor lockers of Butler Library and the third floor lockers of Lerner Hall, but the Butler Library lockers are randomly assigned by lottery with “<a href="https://library.columbia.edu/services/lio/butler-lockers.html">no preferences considered</a>” and the Lerner Hall lockers are <a href="https://lernerhall.columbia.edu/lockers">exclusive to General Studies students</a>. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Another option is to rent a Dodge Fitness Center locker, which is not included in the student membership covered by tuition fees. <a href="https://perec.columbia.edu/content/fall-21-memberships">Costs for overnight lockers</a> range from $60 for a 12-inch tall locker to $120 for a 60-inch tall locker. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Torres rented a 60-inch locker with the intention of storing his electric scooter, which he bought as an alternative to biking because he “didn’t like sitting in class sweaty.” The scooter ended up not fitting in his locker and with no place to store it, he now plans to return it. With the winter months approaching, Torres says he will “ride the bike to the train until [he cannot] bear it.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “I don’t really have a place where I could store things because the lockers that are available that you have to pay for are pretty small,” Torres said. “I would love if they were like, ‘Yeah, here, grab a locker.’” </p> <div class="image width-undefined"> <img src="REJP6AOMFVHMJOLKA6KRQK7BQI.fdd135c8.tif"> <p class="image-caption-text"> Ally Woodward is a student at the school of General Studies. <span class="image-credit"> Photograph by Maria Shaughnessy / Columbia Daily Spectator </span> </p> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> In addition to the lack of resources for commuting students, Ally Woodard, GS ’23, who lives a 20-minute walk away from campus, said that the “social dynamic is different” for commuters and feels “there’s definitely a bit of a disconnect.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “You just really have to be very outgoing and proactive if you’re living off campus and you want to get involved and you want to meet people,” Woodard said. “I went through the clubs and organizations page on Columbia's website, and I signed [up] even if I was remotely interested in something. I think I get more emails about clubs than I do about schoolwork.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Because many club meetings take place in the evening, Miranda said he felt he did not have the luxury to join any organizations because of his worries about commuting back home. A member of the Latinx Dance Troupe “Sabor,” Amaya often stays on campus for rehearsals until midnight and then travels the 45 to 60 minutes back to Brooklyn. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> On top of the social challenges commuting poses, Woodard believes being FLI presents additional “barriers for socializing” at a university where only about <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/the-eye/2020/12/14/new-columbia-bubble-first-generation-low-income-students-form-the-majority-in-pandemic-era-dorms/">17 percent of undergraduates</a> identify as FLI. For Amaya, the general “lack of sympathy and lack of understanding” for FLI students from the Columbia community “translates to a lack of support.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “There can be a divide for sure. If everyone’s going to do something really expensive, I can hang out with other people who aren't going to do something expensive this weekend and save up,” Woodard said. “But I could imagine if you're 17, 18, and it’s like, ‘Oh, my gosh, all my friends and the people who I’ve met are going to Governor’s Ball, and I can’t afford that,’ that would be emotionally difficult and make someone feel disconnected.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Commuters only had access to on-campus residence halls from Sept. 9 to Sept. 17 before a rise in the COVID-19 positivity rate led to <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2021/09/17/columbia-implements-10-person-limit-on-indoor-gatherings-restricts-residence-hall-access-to-residents-only/">Columbia Housing suspending commuter access</a> to dormitories for two weeks. The other time the term “commuters” had appeared in a Columbia email prior to this was on Sept. 10 to inform commuting students they needed to be signed in by a resident host to enter the residence halls. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “The only time I saw the term ‘commuter students’ come up in anything was to tell us that we are banned from campus housing until further notice,” Amaya said. “I didn’t see any resources explicitly, or if they were there, [they] were not made explicit to me.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Even following the lift of the two-week dorm restrictions for commuters, Amaya had an incident with a Public Safety officer while trying to enter Wien Hall because he needed a place to stay for the night. Amaya said the officer was being “very rude” and refused to let Amaya in, despite Amaya explaining he lived off-campus and attended the University. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Amaya went to the Hartley Hospitality desk and was told there was no issue scanning his CUID. They sent him to Public Safety, where the department called the security guard at Wien Hall to let him into the residence hall. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “I had to explain to them I’m a commuter student, I live off campus, I read the policies. … I know what I’m allowed and allowed not to do,” Amaya said. “With COVID policy, I’m not welcome everywhere because I’ve lost that kind of access. … It’s disheartening because this doesn’t feel like a home anymore, it feels like a job. I’m not getting the same college experience as the rest of my peers.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Besides the dorm restrictions, not having easy access to permanent indoor lounge spaces like residential students limits where commuting students can spend their time. While General Studies students have their own <a href="https://gs.columbia.edu/content/student-lounge">dedicated lounge in Lewisohn Hall</a>, Torres says it feels like a work area. As someone who “loves naps,” he adds, “there’s definitely nowhere to nap.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “During the policy where commuter students weren’t allowed into any dorms, I would literally be just taking naps on a random couch in the Diana Center on Barnard’s campus,” Amaya said. “I’m here from 10 a.m. way past 10 p.m., I’m here for more than 12 hours, I need a nap to refuel at one point.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Archambeau hopes to talk to the administration about opening a space similar to the General Studies student lounge where commuting students can relax and store their items. While CCSC plans to implement several initiatives to support FLI commuting students, Archambeau sees “structural change being absolutely necessary.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “We have so much on our plates already as FLI kids. I just want the administration to step up and not have us provide our own solutions, but rather they do their due diligence,” Amaya said. “As long as Columbia fails to address the needs and concerns, even the visibility of commuter students and our circumstances, I’m still going to feel I do not belong because the administration doesn’t see me, they don’t recognize me, they don’t see my issues for what they are.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <i>Staff writer Isabella Ramírez can be contacted at </i><a href="mailto:isabella.ramirez@columbiaspectator.com"><i>isabella.ramirez@columbiaspectator.com</i></a><i>.
